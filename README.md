#Fictional Constellation Map Generator

This is a Javascript/HTML5 Canvas algorithm to eventually generate a constellation
map of a fictional sky somewhere. 

At the moment the code generates one constellation, but will generate a few of them
on the background of a grid and maybe a milky way type object, as well as procedurally
generated names for each constellation.
